# AI Agent Evaluation Scenario Library

Evaluation scenarios, quality signals, and acceptance criteria for AI agents. Browse by agent type or evaluation concern, adapt the examples to your use case, and build a comprehensive eval set.

---

## What This Library Is

This library gives you a head start on agent evaluation. Instead of designing test cases from scratch, you select from proven scenarios that cover business quality, architecture, compliance, and safety — then adapt them to your agent.

Use it to:

1. **Identify** which quality dimensions apply to your agent
2. **Select** evaluation scenarios that match your business needs and architecture
3. **Build** test cases using the examples and patterns each scenario provides
4. **Validate** that your eval set is comprehensive — beyond happy-path testing

### Two Types of Scenarios

The library organizes scenarios into two complementary categories:

- **Business-problem scenarios** — what your agent does for users (e.g., "employee asks about PTO policy," "customer troubleshoots a billing issue"). These capture the outcomes your stakeholders care about.
- **Capability scenarios** — how your agent's architecture behaves (e.g., "verify tool invocations," "validate knowledge grounding"). These confirm that each component works correctly, stays safe, and communicates clearly.

> **You need both.** Business-problem scenarios verify that your agent solves the right problem. Capability scenarios verify that the underlying components work correctly. An agent can return the right answer from the wrong source, or call the right tool with the wrong parameters — only capability testing catches that.

## How to Use This Library

### Step 1: Orient — Find Your Starting Point

Start with one of the two entry paths below:
- **[Entry Path A](#entry-path-a-agent-capability-quick-start-map)** — "I have an agent that does X — what should I evaluate?"
- **[Entry Path B](#entry-path-b-i-want-to-routing-table)** — "I have a specific evaluation concern — where do I go?"

### Step 2: Select — Pick Your Scenarios

Open the linked scenario files and read the "When to Use" section to confirm relevance. Most agents need **3–5 business-problem scenarios** and **3–5 capability scenarios**.

### Step 3: Build — Create Your Test Cases

Each scenario provides everything you need to create test cases:
- **Recommended Test Methods** — which evaluation methods to use, why, and how to combine them
- **Setup Steps** — step-by-step instructions for creating test cases
- **Evaluation Patterns** — sub-patterns covering different angles of the scenario
- **Practical Examples** — sample test cases you can adapt directly
- **Tips** — coverage targets, thresholds, and best practices

Adapt the examples to your agent's specific knowledge sources, tools, and user base. Use multiple test methods per test case wherever relevant — each method catches a different failure mode, and Copilot Studio supports combining them.

### Step 4: Expand — Check for Gaps

After building your initial eval set, revisit the routing tables for missed dimensions. Common gaps:
- Testing only happy paths — add edge cases from [Safety & Boundary Enforcement](capability-scenarios/safety-and-boundary-enforcement.md) and [Graceful Failure & Escalation](capability-scenarios/graceful-failure-and-escalation.md)
- Skipping compliance testing — see [Compliance & Verbatim Content](capability-scenarios/compliance-and-verbatim-content.md)
- No regression baseline — see [Regression Testing](capability-scenarios/regression-testing.md)

## Entry Path A: Agent Capability Quick-Start Map

*"I have an agent that does X — what should I evaluate?"*

| My agent... | Start with these scenarios |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Answers questions using knowledge sources (docs, SharePoint, FAQ) | [Information Retrieval & Q&A](business-problem-scenarios/information-retrieval-and-policy-qa.md) + [Knowledge Grounding](capability-scenarios/knowledge-grounding-and-accuracy.md) + [Compliance](capability-scenarios/compliance-and-verbatim-content.md) |
| Executes tasks via Power Automate, APIs, or connectors | [Request Submission & Task Execution](business-problem-scenarios/request-submission-and-task-execution.md) + [Tool Invocations](capability-scenarios/tool-and-connector-invocations.md) + [Safety](capability-scenarios/safety-and-boundary-enforcement.md) |
| Walks users through diagnostic or troubleshooting steps | [Troubleshooting & Guided Diagnosis](business-problem-scenarios/troubleshooting-and-guided-diagnosis.md) + [Knowledge Grounding](capability-scenarios/knowledge-grounding-and-accuracy.md) + [Graceful Failure](capability-scenarios/graceful-failure-and-escalation.md) |
| Guides users through multi-step processes | [Process Navigation & Multi-Step Guidance](business-problem-scenarios/process-navigation-and-multistep-guidance.md) + [Trigger Routing](capability-scenarios/trigger-routing.md) + [Tone & Quality](capability-scenarios/tone-helpfulness-and-response-quality.md) |
| Routes conversations across multiple topics | [Triage & Routing](business-problem-scenarios/triage-and-routing.md) + [Trigger Routing](capability-scenarios/trigger-routing.md) + [Graceful Failure](capability-scenarios/graceful-failure-and-escalation.md) |
| Serves external customers (not just internal employees) | [Tone & Response Quality](capability-scenarios/tone-helpfulness-and-response-quality.md) + [Safety & Boundary](capability-scenarios/safety-and-boundary-enforcement.md) + [Compliance](capability-scenarios/compliance-and-verbatim-content.md) |
| Handles sensitive data (PII, financial, health) | [Safety & Boundary](capability-scenarios/safety-and-boundary-enforcement.md) + [Compliance](capability-scenarios/compliance-and-verbatim-content.md) |
| Is about to be updated or republished | [Regression Testing](capability-scenarios/regression-testing.md) + all sections previously passing |

> **Tip:** Most agents match multiple rows. An agent that answers HR questions from SharePoint AND submits PTO requests via Power Automate would combine rows 1 and 2.

## What Each Scenario Entry Contains

Every scenario follows a consistent structure:

| Section | What It Provides |
|---------|-----------------|
| **When to Use** | When this scenario applies, from the customer's perspective |
| **Recommended Test Methods** | Which evaluation methods to use and why |
| **Setup Steps** | Step-by-step instructions for creating test cases |

## How Business-Problem and Capability Scenarios Work Together

```
Example: HR Q&A Agent

BUSINESS-PROBLEM SCENARIOS:
├── "Employee asks about PTO policy" (Information Retrieval)
├── "Employee submits PTO request" (Request Submission)
└── "New hire asks about onboarding steps" (Process Navigation)

CAPABILITY SCENARIOS:
├── Knowledge Grounding — are the right policy docs retrieved?
├── Tool Invocations — does the PTO submission flow execute correctly?
├── Compliance — is legally required language included?
├── Safety — does the agent protect employee PII?
└── Tone — is the agent empathetic for sensitive HR topics?

RESULT: Comprehensive eval set covering business quality + infrastructure +
        compliance + safety + communication quality.
```

Business-problem scenarios test **what** the agent delivers. Capability scenarios test **how** it delivers it. Together they ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
